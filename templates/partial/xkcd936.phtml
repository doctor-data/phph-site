<p>
    Your password is salted and hashed using PHP's
    <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php"><code>password_hash</code></a> function. The only
    restriction we have is that your password must be at least 8 characters. However, remember
    <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">xkcd 936</a> when choosing your password!
